# DKNightVersion
DKNightVersion is a light weight framework. It's built through `objc/runtime` library, providing a neat approach  adding night version to your iOS app. A great many of code for this framework is generated by Ruby script.

The most delightful feature of DKNightVersion is that it appends one more property `nightColor` to frequently-used UIKit components. It is easily-used and well-designed. Hope you have a great joy to use DKNightVersion to integrate night mode in your Apps.

# How to use

API documentation is not available now.

## Using night color

This framework is based on a property `nightColor`, such as `nightBackgroundColor` `nightTextColor`...

Assign the night version color you want to the `UIKit` component:

```
self.view.nightBackgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
self.label.nightTextColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
```

## Using DKNightVersionManager change theme

Use `DKNightVersionManager` sets the theme.

```
[DKNightVersionManager nightFalling];
```

If you'd like to switch back to normal theme version:

```
[DKNightVersionManager dawnComing];
```

## Using default night version

You can turn off the default night mode color and set it on your own.

```
[DKNightVersionManager setUseDefaultNightColor:NO];
```

If you turn on this function, you could also change the `nightColor` property of any UIKit instances. 

## Picking Color

DKNightVersionManager will pick the proper color by check the `nightColor` you set first. If you didn't provide a `nightColor` and `useDefaultNightColor` is `YES`, the manager then return the default night color. But when you turn the default behavior off, manager would return normal color you set.

1. `useDefaultNightColor == YES` (The default behavior)

`nightColor` > `defaultNightColor` > `normalColor`

2. `useDefaultNightColor == NO`

`nightColor` > `normalColor`
